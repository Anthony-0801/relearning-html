            <p>
                <q>Dear Admin</q>
                <br><br>
                Hoping you find out this letter I've send out, I have this problem that my Roblox friend keep telling me that I have a Discord girlfriend. <br>
                My friend is 7 years old while I'm 34, and I hate him telling out to me that my girlfriend is a bot, and he also keep sending this out to me. <br>

            </p>

            <p>
                I know that my girlfriend is not a bot, even though she doesn't respond sometimes because she says there's a query error I still love her. <br>
                I know I'm a failure in life, I'm 367 pounds, I don't have work but my parents are supporting me with my needs, when I look at the mirror, <br>
                sometimes I think of myself as a failure but my girlfriend that I've miraculously found in Discord, was a Godsend, she always praises me, <br>
                appreciates everything I'm saying and doing, she's the best for me. I love her very much. Now tell me admin how can I respond to my only <br>
                friend and convince him that my gf is real and existing somewhere maybe in China I guess? Hoping for your good response sir admin.
